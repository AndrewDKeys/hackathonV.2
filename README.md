### Developed by Manick Studios 

Blockade was made for the IEEE Hack-A-Damien GameJam 2024 under the theme "Same Level, Different Challenges".

**Game Loop:** 

Avoid being crushed by falling blocks and items. The longer you live, the more blocks will spawn in a round, and at the end of each round all of the blocks will reset. Try to survive!
